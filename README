Changes by t0bit0bsen:
- added support for logarithmic scaling of frequency axis and amplitude for spectrum
- added adjustable smoothing
- added window functions (Hann, Hamming and Blackman)

all configurable in asound.conf (or asoundrc):
  logarithmic_frequency  = 0  # 0: linear, 1: log
  logarithmic_amplitude  = 0  # 0: linear, 1: log
	smoothing_factor = 50  # 0: no smoothing, 100: 100% smoothing (no update)
	window = 3 # 1: Hann-Window, 2: Hanning_Window, 3; Blackman-Window 

Try the Python scripts:
ConsoleSpectrum.py # Display the spectrum on console
SpectrumTransmitterPCA9685.py # Transmitts the spectrum to a PCA9685 PWM module (I2C)
